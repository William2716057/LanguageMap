Overview
This web application uses Leaflet for creating the map and markers and integrates p5.js for additional interactivity.



Usage
Open the index.html file in your web browser. You should see a map with clickable markers representing different languages.

Click on a marker to view information about the language and a link to view a sample.

To customize the data or markers, you can modify the languages2.csv file and adjust the JavaScript code in sketch.js as needed.

Data Source
The language data is loaded from a CSV file named languages2.csv. You can replace this file with your own dataset, following the same format (latitude, longitude, language name, etc.).
