### Overview
- This web application uses Leaflet for creating the map and markers and integrates p5.js for additional interactivity.

### Usage
1. Open the index.html file in your web browser. You should see a map with clickable markers representing different languages.
2. Click on a marker to view information about the language and a link to view a sample.
3. To customize the data or markers, you can modify the languages2.csv file and adjust the JavaScript code in sketch.js as needed.

### Data Source
- The language data is loaded from a CSV file named languages2.csv. You can replace this file with your own dataset, following the same format (latitude, longitude, language name, etc.).
